1. The OpenHands Software Agent SDK is a set of Python and REST APIs for building agents that work with code, supporting tasks from simple README generation to complex multi-agent refactors and rewrites.

2. The SDK supports multiple workspace environments - agents can either use the local machine as their workspace or run inside ephemeral workspaces (e.g., in Docker or Kubernetes) using the Agent Server.

3. The project is organized into multiple sub-packages including openhands-sdk, openhands-tools, openhands-workspace, and openhands-agent-server, and powers production applications like the OpenHands CLI and OpenHands Cloud.
