    Properties define rules that help maintain the integrity and coherence of the events
    in the view. The properties are maintained via two strategies:

    1. Enforcing the property by removing events that violate it.
    2. Defining manipulation indices that restrict where the view can be manipulated.

    In an ideal scenario, sticking to the manipulation indices should suffice to ensure
    the property holds. Enforcement is only intended as a fallback mechanism to handle
    edge cases, bad data, or unforeseen situations.
