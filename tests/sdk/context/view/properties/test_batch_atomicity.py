"""Tests for BatchAtomicityProperty.

This module tests the BatchAtomicityProperty class independently from the View class.
The property ensures that ActionEvents sharing the same llm_response_id form an atomic
unit that cannot be split during condensation.

Note: View-level integration tests for batch atomicity also exist in
tests/sdk/context/view/test_view_batch_atomicity.py. These tests will eventually
be removed once we're satisfied with the property-level tests.
