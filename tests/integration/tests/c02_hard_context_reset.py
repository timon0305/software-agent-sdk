"""Test hard context reset when condensation range is invalid.

This test verifies that:
1. When condensation is explicitly requested via conversation.condense()
2. But condensation range is invalid due to insufficient events in history
3. A hard context reset is performed instead of raising an exception
4. The conversation can continue successfully after the hard context reset
5. After continuing, a second condensation (normal, not hard reset) can occur
6. The view is well-formed with both the hard context reset and normal summary
7. All events are forgotten in hard reset, only some in normal condensation
8. Forgotten events are excluded from the final view
9. Summary events are at correct positions in the view
