"""Test hard condensation requirement triggers hard context reset.

This test verifies that:
1. When condensation is explicitly requested via conversation.condense()
2. But no valid condensation range exists (only 1 event in history)
3. A hard context reset is performed instead of raising an exception
4. The conversation can continue successfully after the hard context reset
